## 16.2 Using a Cybersecurity Framework

In this excercise, I will review a subcategory of the NIST [Framework for Improving 
Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04162018.pdf). 
This framework is designed to provide a structuted approach when reviewing an existing cybersecurity program. The Framework Core provides five key outcomes, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover.
The framework then breaks these outcomes into categories and subcategories while providing the titles of relevant reference documents.

In this excercise, select a specific category and then subcategory. Below is a breakdown of how an organization could addresses these subcategories.

## 16.3 Compliance Auditing Tools
In this section I will review an aspect of the the Payment Card Industry (PCI) [Data Security Standard](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library).
Specifically, I will analyze the requirements of password construction from section 8.2.3 and how to 
determine wether an organization is in compliance with this requirement.
