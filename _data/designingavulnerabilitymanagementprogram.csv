Term,Definition
Active Scanning ,The scanning actively engages and tests the host for vulnerabilities. 
Agent-based Scanning,Systems run a lightweight agent which scans and reports back to the scanning server
Barries to Scanning,"Fear of service degradations, Rigid customer agreements, IT Governance and Change management processes"
Common Vulnerability Scanning Tools,"Tenable Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7 Nexpose and OpenVAS"
Compensating Control,Additional steps taken to address a vulnerability without fully remediating it
CPE,Common Platform Enumeration; SCAP component that provides standard naming for products and versions
Credentialed Scanning,"Providing system access to a scan allowing access to operating systems, databases and applications"
CVSS,"Common Vulnerability Scoring System, provides a standardised approach for measuring vulnerability severity"
Determining Scan Frequency,"Depends on organisation's risk appetite, compliance standards, target system technical constraints, business constraints and licensing limitations"
External Scan PCI DSS Scan,Must be run an approved scanning vendor
Federal Agency Scanning Scope,"Applies to low, moderate and high impact systems"
FISMA,Federal Information Security Act
Identifying Scan Targets,"Targets are often identified by asset criticality, data classification of the info stored, system exposure to the internet or private networks and environment type of the system"
Interception Proxies,Run on a tester's system and intercept requests from the web browser to the web server before being released; can be classified as an exploit tool.
Ongoing Scanning,"Similar to continuous monitoring, constantly scans the network for vulnerabilities, instead of traditional scheduled scanning"
Passive Scanning,"Monitor the network passively, looking for outdated or vulnerable systems"
PCI DSS,Payment Card Data Security Standard
PCI DSS Internal Scannin Scope,Scans only need to be run on systems dedicated to credit card processing.
PCI DSS Scan Frequency,Scans must be performed quarterly at a minimum
Prioritizing Remediation,"Deciding factors include: Criticality of systems affected, Difficulty of remediation, Severity of the Vulnerability, Exposure of the vulnerability"
Remediation Workflow,"After a scan, organisations should have a workflow that prioritises testing, detection and remediation of detected vulnerabilities"
Scan Perspective,Running scans from different network vantage points and the internet in order to provide a different view into potential vulnerabilities
Scan Scope,What systems and networks will be included in the scan; What kind of scan will be conducted.
SCAP,"Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a multi-purpose framework of specifications that supports automated configuration, vulnerability and patch checking, technical control compliance activities, and security measurement."
Vulnerability Feeds,"Ensures scans have the latest virus signatures, file hashes and plugins in order to scan for specified vulnerabilities"
Vulnerability Management Program,"Seeks to identify, prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities"
Web App Scanning Tools,"Common tools include Nikito, command line based, and Archani"
Wireless Assessment Tools,"Air crack-ng, Reaver, Hashcat (formerly known as oclHashcat)"
Zed Attack Proxy,Popular open source interception proxy
