Term,Definition
Active Network Monitoring,"Reaches out to remote systems to gather data. Gathers data about availability, routes, packet delay/loss and bandwidth. Ping and iPerf are two examples."
Bandwidth Consumption,Can cause service outages and disruptions of security functions - a serious concern
Baseline Detection,Aka anomaly detection. Alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
Beaconing,Heartbeat traffic sent to a hackers command and control server -- usually over http or https
DDoS,Distributed Denial of Service Attack -- DOS attack which comes from multiple networks simultaneously
Detecting Malware Techniques,"Central management tools, antimalware tools, software files and blacklisting, application whitelisting."
df,Linux tool - displays a report of a system's disk usage
Heuristics,Behaviour based detection. Alerts when strange behaviours are detected.
Host-related Checking Techniques,"Processor monitoring, Memory monitoring, Drive capacity monitoring, filesystem changes and anomalies"
iPerf,Measures max BW that an IP Network can handle. Allows remote testing of link BW in addition to internal BW testing. Useful for establishing a network baseline.
Linux Services,"Managed by running service --status-all and by checking ""/etc/init.d/service name/ status"""
Malicious Scheduled Tasks,Check cron in Linux and task scheduler in windows
Memory Leak,Occurs when a program does not release its memory even after it is no longer being used - this will result in increased consumption until the program crashes
Passive Monitoring,"Captures network data as traffic passes along a location on a network, such as collecting tap data.  V"
perfmon,Windows performance monitoring utility - best for more detailed graphing
Potentially Malicious Windows Tools,"cmd.exe, at.exe, schtasks.exe, wmic.exe, powershell.exe, net.exe, reg.exe, sc.exe"
Protocol Analysis,Captures packets and looks for unexpected traffic types in order to detect an attacker
PRTG,"Paessler Router Traffic Grapher, tool which provides packet sniffing, flows, SNMP and WMI"
ps,Linux tool - provides cpu and mem utilisation
Registry Run Keys,"Located at: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_CURRENT_USER"
resmon,Windows Resource Monitoring utility - best for checking basic metrics
Rogue  Checking Techniques,"Valid MAC address checking, MAC address vendor checking, Network Scanning, Site Surveys, Traffic Analysis"
Rogue Devices,An unwanted device connected to your network
Router-based Monitoring,"Available options include Netflow, RMON, SNMP"
SCOM,System Center Operations Manager - Windows monitoring tool
sysinternals,Additional advanced windows monitoring tools
top,Linux tool - provides cpu and mem utilisation along with stats about processes
w,Linux tool - indicates which accounts are logged in
Windows Services,Managed in services.msc
Wire Rogue Checking Techniques,MAC Port Security or Network Access Control can prevent this
WMI,Windows Management Instrumentation
