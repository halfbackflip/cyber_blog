Term,Definition
Directory,"Centralized repository of names, address, title, email, contact info, principal name, etc for auth purposes."
Privilege Management,Ongoing management of user rights to perform actions or gain access to systems
IAM systems,Identity and access management systems allow for central management of user info
Directory Services,"AD, LDAP, provide info about systems, users and other info."
TACAS+,Uses TCP to provide AAA services for network devices; suffers from several security flaws and should only be used on isolated networks
RADIUS,"Can operate via TCP or UDP, provides AAA for network devices, wireless and other services."
Kerberos,"AAA service designed to operate on untrusted networks, separates untrusted networks into realms, key distribution centers and groups of principals"
OpenID,"Open source standard for decentralized identity, i.e. users create a Gmail account and use that identity to authenticate to other services"
Oath,Open authorization standard; Uses tokens; Allows users to share elements of their identity or account info while authenticating via the original identity provider
OpenID Connect,"Authentication layer built using the Oath protocol, often paired with Oauth and allows authorization server to issue an ID token"
Facebook Connect,Facebook based authentication protocol
RBAC,"Role Based Access Control - Roles with permissions are assigned to users, groups, systems, etc."
ABAC,"Attribute Based Access Control - Provides users rights based on policies which are collections of attributes, i.e. job title, responsibilities, position, location, etc."
MAC,Mandatory Access Control - Rigid; Relies on the OS to control what access and rights a user has; Implemented by a system admin.
Rule Based AC,Rule Based Access Control - Access based on a set of rules or ACLs set by an admin
DAC,Discretionary Access Control - Delegates control of resource privileges to admins or owners of protected resources 
Personnel Security,"Includes training and awareness - faces threats such as phishing, insider attacks and social engineering"
Server Exploits,Target the systems which run identity services
KDC,"Key Distribution Centre, centralized key store in Kerberos, hotspot for attackers"
Common Kerberos Attacks,"KDC attacks, Admin Account Compromise, Kerberos Ticket Reuse, TGT Ticket Granting Server attacks"
Common Radius Attacks,"Session replay of server responses, Targeting of the RADIUS shared secret, DoS attacks to prevent authentication, Brute-force attack against credentials"
Common AD Attacks,"Deploying credential capturing malware, credential theft via phishing, privilege escalation attacks, service account compromise, excessive domain admin rights, Group policy attacks"
Account Lifecycle,"Create an account, Set account permissions, Maintain Account, Disable Account, Retire and delete account"
Privilege Creep,Steady accrual of privileges and rights over time
Common Identity and Authorization Exploits,"Impersonation, MitM, Session Hijacking, Privilege Escalation, Rootkits"
Session Hijacking,Focuses on taking over already existing sessions by acquiring the session key or cookies used by a remote server
Identity Defence in Depth,Create only valid accounts - Consistent provisioning of accounts - Track accounts to avoid privilege creep - Ensure complete account termination
Privileged User Management,"The management of administrative and other super user rights, additional monitoring and logging"
MFA Factors,"Knowledge, possession, biometric, location"
Context-based authentication,"System which allows authentication decisions to be made based on info about the user, i.e. user group membership, ip address, time of day, location, frequency of access, device-based info, etc."
IDAAS,"Identity As A Service - Cloud based services which provide directory services, identity life cycle management, sso, privileged account mgmt., reporting, auditing and other mgmt capabilities"
Federation,The process of connecting an identity and its related attributes between multiple identity management systems
IDP,Identity Provider - In a federation must provide identities and release info about the identity
RP,Relying Party - In a federation must provide services to members of the federation
Consumer,User of federated services - may be asked to make decisions about attribute release and provide validation info about identity claims to the IDP
Federated Identity Technologies,"SAML, OpenID, OAuth2, ADFS"
SAML,"Security Assertion Mark-up Language - Used to send authentication and authorization info between identity and service providers in enterprise, Linux-centric environments"
ADFS,"Active Directory Federation Services - Used to send authentication and authorization info between identity and service providers in enterprise, windows-centric environments"
