Term,Definition
CVSS,Common Vulnerability Scoring System; A standard for assessing the severity of security vulnerabilities
Attack Vector Metric,"Describes how an attacker would exploit the vulnerability: Physical, Local, Adjacent Network or Network"
Attack Complexity Metric,Refers to the difficult in exploiting a metric. Assigned a value of High or Low.
Privileges Required Metric,"Describes the level of account access required to exploit the vulnerability. Assigned a value of High, Low or None."
User Interaction Metric,Describes whether the attacker needs to involve another human in the attack. Assigned a value of None or Required.
Confidentiality Metric,"Refers to the kind of information leaked in the event of a successful attack. Assigned a value of None, Low or High."
Integrity Metric,"Refers to the kind of information alteration that could occur from an attack. Assigned a value of None, Low or High."
Availability Metric,"Describes the level of service disruption that could occur in the event of a successful attack. Assigned a value of None, Low or High."
Scope Metric,Describes whether the vulnerability can effect system components beyond the scope of the vulnerability. Assigned a value of Unchanged of Changed.
CVSS Vector,Uses a single line to convey several metrics adding up to a vulnerability score. 
CVSS Base Score,"Total vulnerability score, ranked 1 to 10."
Report Types,"True positive, false positive, true negative, false negative"
Buffer Overflow,Attack when an attacker manipulates a program into placing more data into an area of memory than is allocated for that program
Privilege Escalation,Attack that increases the level of access an attacker has to a system
Arbitrary Code Execution,Allows the attacker to run code of their choice on a machine and can be particularly destructive with admin privileges
Remote Code Execution,Vulnerability which allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability over a network connection without physical or logical access to a system
Debug Mode,"If left on in an unsecured network, can provide an attacker with critical information on how to attack an application"
TLS,"Transport Layer Security, version 1.2 is the most secure -- SSL is insecure. Provide a mechanism for selecting crypto algorithms in transit."
Certificate,"Used by TLS to validate the identity of a server and exchange crypto keys. Cert expiration, name mismatch and an unknown Certificate Authority are all security issues."
VM Escape,Vulnerability where an attacker is able to break out of a single virtual host and access another host or the management interface
SCADA,Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System
PLC,Programmable Logic Controller
RTO,Real Time Operating System; slimmed down OS for working on IOT systems
SOC,System On a Chip -- An entire system embedded on a single chip
FPGA,Field-programmable Gate Arrays -- computer chips that allow the end user to re-program their functions
CAN Bus,Controller Area Network Bus; Specialized networks designed to facilitate communication between embedded systems without TCP/IP
XSS,Cross Site Scripting -- commands are injected on a site that will run on a users system
Persistent XSS,XSS scripts are installed on a server 
Reflected XSS,XSS scripts are sent from the user to the server -- then reflected back at the user
DOM XSS,XSS attack that occurs within the database maintained by a users web browser
Credential Stuffing,An attacker takes a list of usernames and passwords stolen in a previous breach -- then tries them all at once.
Password Spraying,"An attacker takes a dictionary of common usernames and passwords, then attempts them all."
Session Hijacking,A Hacker takes over an existing session and causes the session to pass through the hacker system.
Injection Attacks,"Include SQL, XML and LDAP injections into web applications"
