Term,Definition
ERM,Enterprise Risk Management
Threat,"Possible event which may have an effect on Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability"
Vulnerabilities,Weakenesses in systems which could be exploited by a threat
Risk,The combination of a threat and a vulnerability
Risk Identification,Identifying the risks and vulnerabilities which exist in your environment
Probability,The likelihood the risk will occur
Magnitude,The impact the risk will have on the organization if it does occur
Risk Formula,Risk Severity = Probability  * Magnitude
BIA,Business Impact Analysis - Formalized approach to risk analysis.
Quantitative Risk Analysis,User numeric data to assess risk
Qualitative Risk Analysis,Use subjective judgements and categories to assess risk
ARO,Annualized Rate of Occurrence; The likelihood an event will occurr in a given year
EF,"Exposure Factor - The amount of damage, percent of an assest to be damaged if a risk occurrs"
SLE,Single Loss Expectancy - The amount of damage expected each time a risk happens
ALE,Annualized Loss Expectancy - Amount of damage expected from a risk every year. Multiply the SLE and ARO
Risk Management,Process of addressing risks that face an organization; Seeks to prioritize risks with high probability and magnited; Also determines if the potenital impact of the risk justifies a certain amount of spending
Risk Mitigation,The process of applying security controls to reduce the probability and magnitude of a risk - most commone approach towards risk management
Risk Avoidance,Risk management strategy where business practices are changed to eliminate a risk - may result in unrealistic sacrifices
Risk Transference,Shifts some of the risk impact from the organization to another entity
Risk Acceptance,Deliberately accepting a risk after thorough consideration. May be warranted if the cost of mitigation is higher than the risk itself.
Data Ownership,Policy where specific senior executives are designated as owners of different data types and must work with other experts to manage/protect the data
Information Classification,Top Secret > Secret > Confidential > Unclassified; Data classification allows organizations to clearly specify the security controls required to protect information

Host-based DLP,Uses agents on systems to detect sensitive info
Network-based DLP,"Dedicated devices that sit on the network and monitor outbound traffic, checking for the exfiltration of data."
Watermarking,Applying electronic tags to sensitive data so it is recognized by DLP systems
Pattern Matching,DLP systems whtat watch for specific sinds of sensitive data
Deidentification,Removing the ability to lind data back to an individual
Data Obfucscation,Changing data into a format where the original cannot be retrieved
Data Obfucscation Methods,"Hashing, Tokenization, Masking"
Tokenization,Replacing sensitive values with a unique identifier using a lookup table
Masking,Partially redacting sensitive info
